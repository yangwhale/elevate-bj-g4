# **Business Requirements Document (BRD) \- HR Agentic Solution (MVP 1\)**

## **Executive Summary**

The HR Agentic Solution is a secure, AI-driven virtual assistant designed to provide employees with immediate, conversational access to HR services. By seamlessly orchestrating workflows across core enterprise systems (WorkWeek, ServiceImmediately) and querying internal HR policies, the assistant will automate routine inquiries and facilitate self-service transactions.

To ensure strict enterprise governance and zero-trust security, this solution will be deployed on a secure, scalable agent orchestration platform, enforce traceably bounded execution, authenticate the automation's origin for all backend operations, and dynamically validate all interactions to protect against malicious instruction overrides and safeguard sensitive information.

---

**1\. Project Objectives**

* **Deflect Tier 1 HR Inquiries:** Reduce routine HR and IT helpdesk ticket volume by at least 40% within the first six months by automating responses to common policy and status queries.  
* **Streamline HR Transactions:** Enable employees to perform core self-service actions (leave submission, Incident ticket updates) conversationally without navigating complex backend UIs.  
* **Validate Cross-System Orchestration**: Demonstrate the capability to chain actions across HR policies, WorkWeek, and ServiceImmediately to fulfill complex user intents, serving as a critical evaluation benchmark for prototype success before scaling.  
* **Enhance Employee Experience:** Provide a unified conversational capability capable of orchestrating complex workflows across multiple backend systems (HCM, ITSM) and knowledge bases.  
* **Ensure Enterprise AI Governance:** Maintain 100% visibility over the solution's deployment state, versioning, and authorized tool access limits.  
* **Mitigate AI Risks:** Achieve zero policy violations and data leaks by intercepting and validating all user inputs and AI-generated outputs through dynamic interaction safeguards.

**2\. Project Scope (MVP 1\)**  
**2.1. Functional Scope (In-Scope for MVP 1\)**  
The solution will support the following conversational interaction types and capabilities:

* **Conversational User Interface (UI)**: A standard, functional web-based chat interface or integration with a readily available enterprise chat client to facilitate direct user interaction and testing.  
* **Policy & Informational Queries:** Answering questions related to HR policies, benefits, and procedures based strictly on approved static documents.  
  * Question Types: "What is the policy on \[Topic\]?", "Am I eligible for \[Benefit\]?", "What is the process for \[Action\]?"  
* **Employee Self-Service Transactions (WorkWeek):**   
  * Read Actions: Fetching real-time employee profile details and leave balances.  
  * Write Actions: Modifying specific personal contact information; submitting new leave requests.  
* **Support Desk Management (ServiceImmediately):**   
  * Read Actions: Checking status, priority, and comment history of specific tickets.  
  * Write Actions: Creating new incidents, adding comments to existing tickets, and updating ticket status (e.g., to 'Resolved').  
* **Cross-System Orchestration:** Chaining actions across domains (e.g., verifying policy eligibility, checking balance in WorkWeek, and creating a request in ServiceImmediately).

**2.2. Data Scope (In-Scope for MVP 1\)**  
The solution will operate upon and have access to the following specific data domains:

* **Static HR Policies:** A curated set of approved documents (PDF/Text) covering core HR domains (e.g., Leave Policies, Expense Guidelines, Remote Work Policy, Code of Conduct).  
* **WorkWeek Data Elements:**  
  * *Employee Profile*: Employee ID, Name, Email, Department, Role, Manager, Hire Date.  
  * *Contact Info*: Personal Address, Personal Phone Number.  
  * *Leave Data*: Accrued, Used, and Remaining balances for "Vacation" and "Sick" categories.  
* **ServiceImmediately Data Elements:**  
  * *Incident Record*: Ticket ID, Short Description, Detailed Description, Category, Priority level, State/Status, Assignee, Comments/Notes timeline.


**2.3. Out of Scope for MVP 1**

* Integration with systems other than WorkWeek, ServiceImmediately, and the designated Policy Repository.  
* Multi-Lingual capabilities  
* Processing of payroll data, performance reviews, or compensation details.  
* Voice-based interactions.

Any tool invocation or requests beyond these defined capabilities must be blocked. |
| **FR-1.2** | **Verification of Request Origin** | All downstream calls must verify that they originate from an authorized automation entity acting on behalf of a specific user. Audit records must clearly differentiate between automated actions performed by the system and manual end-user inputs. |

| **NFR-4.2**	 | **Transient Fault Tolerance** | The system must implement retry logic (e.g., exponential backoff) for transient failures (e.g., network timeouts, rate limits) before reporting a service failure to the user. |
| **NFR-4.3**	 | **Orchestration Consistency** | For Cross-System Orchestration (UC-2.x), if one step fails (e.g., Leave submitted in WorkWeek but Ticket creation fails in ServiceImmediately), the system must log the failure clearly and provide instructions for manual follow-up or attempt compensating actions to ensure data consistency. |

## **6\. MVP 1 Implementation Constraints**

To scope the initial release effectively, the following boundaries and constraints apply to MVP 1:

* **Authentication & Credentials:** The system will use functional test credentials for backend integrations. Integrations with enterprise identity management systems (such as Active Directory, Okta, or Single Sign-On / SSO) are excluded from this release.  
* **Tenancy Scope:** The initial implementation targets a single-tenant environment. Multi-tenancy support is not required or supported for MVP 1\.
