# **1\. Executive Summary & Scope Boundaries**

## **1.1. Business Overview & Context**

Document the business challenge, pain points in the current workflow, and the high-level business goals.

## **1.2. Scope Boundaries**

Define explicit system boundaries (in scope & out of scope) to prevent scope creep during delivery.

## **1.3. Target Architecture Overview**

Provide a high-level visual representation and description of the core system components, hosting environments, and orchestration layers.

\[Insert High-Level System Architecture Diagrams Here\]

## **1.4. Alternatives Considered**

Compare chosen technical selections against viable alternatives, detailing trade-offs and rationale.

# **2\. Production-Ready Future State Design**

Provide details on future extensibility and architecture details of the solution as it would evolve in the future and as it will be rolled out into production.
